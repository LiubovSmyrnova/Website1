    <h2>My horse Defender ST</h2>
    <img width="720" height="480" src="https://iili.io/Hc8ppov.jpg" alt="2 yo" title="Defender" border="0">
    <p>I love horses from the age I can't remember and have always dreamed
        about having a horse by myself. I am from poor 
        family in Ukraine and it always seem impossible.
        <br>
         But in 2018 I started work in Danmark
        and could save enough money to buy a horse! And with help of
        one incredible person and my boss at that time I could by a perfect
        colt named Defender.
        <br>
        I bought him in April 2019 when he was only
        2 month old. He is turning 4 this year and I still can't bealive!
        At that moment I became the happiest <s>horsemom</s> horse owner!

    <p>So from 2019 to the end 2020 I've been visiting him in Ukraine in stud farm where he was born. 
        I was able to have him there until he's got stronger in his body and could make a big
        trip to Denmark. 
        <br>
        But unfortunatly I did'nt get working visa in Denmark and had to go back to Ukraine.
        So the future was very uncertain at that point. I managed to get a job in Sweden and moved here. 
        <br>
        I was planning to get him to Sweden as well, but it couldn't work because of difficulty in documents 
        I should have had to move him here. So I made a decision to get him to Denmark, exactly same stable I was
        working before.
        <br>
        From the end of 2021 he is enjoying his life there and learning new things. 
        <h1>Third chapter</h1>
        <h2>Oldenburg breed</h2>
        <p>As wikipedia says "The Oldenburg or Oldenburger is a warmblood horse from the north-western corner of Lower Saxony, 
            what was formerly the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. They are highly intelligent, and this makes them easier to train. 
            <br>
            The Oldenburg has become particularly successful in dressage, owing much of its continued success to sires like Donnerhall 
            and now Sandro Hit, who top the rankings in the production of dressage horses.
            <br>
            Defender is Oldenburger as well and he is the kindest horse. Let me show his father, so you have an idea how he could
            look in few years!
