    <p>I love horses from the age I can't remember and have always dreamed
        about having a horse by myself. I am from poor 
        family in Ukraine and it always seem impossible. But in 2018 I started work in Danmark
        and could save enough money to buy a horse! And with help of
        one incredible person and my boss at that time I could by a perfect
        colt named Defender.I bought him in April 2019 when he was only
        2 month old. He is turning 4 this year and I still can't bealive!
        At that moment I became the happiest <s>horsemom</s> horse owner!
